# Project_Flashcards
This project allows managing flashcard decks and studying those decks.
It can be used to study any subject by building a deck and adding cards to it.
Decks and cards can be edited, added, or removed individually.
It uses React to render the program and manage editing decks and cards.
For now, this is complete, but it would be nice to add more features in the future, such as making cards appear in a random order.
